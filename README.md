# ‚öΩ Premier League Match Predictor  

Predict the outcome of Premier League matches using machine learning!  
This project explores football match data, applies data preprocessing, and trains predictive models to forecast match results.

## üìñ Overview  
This notebook (`predictions.ipynb`) walks through:  
- Collecting and preparing Premier League match data  
- Feature engineering (team form, home/away stats, goals scored/conceded, etc.)  
- Training predictive models (e.g., scklearn, Random Forest, beautifulsoup)  
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices  
- Generating predictions for upcoming fixtures  

The goal: **Can we use historical data to accurately predict wins, draws, or losses in the Premier League?**
